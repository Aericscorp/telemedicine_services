Doctor-on-demand &amp; telemedicine services

## References
Telemedicine is not only a comfort for patients and doctors, as it saves time and commute costs. It is also a step towards better safety precautions for all. 

There are a couple of successful tools on the market: Doctor on Demand, Amwell or Docplanner But there's still room for improvement, and space on the market for new comprehensive solutions. We're talking tools for scheduling regular online doctor appointments, doctor-on-demand emergency consultations. These have to be apps that enable in-app video conferencing, swift file transfer, and payments all in one place. COVID-19 triggered medical centers to implement some guerrilla and ASAP-ready solutions (mobile calls, Skype or Zoom calls), but they will soon search for more stable options to integrate with their systems.
